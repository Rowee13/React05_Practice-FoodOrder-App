React Practice App - Food Order App

Practice App as part of my React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux) course on udemy.

This is just a simple react app that uses React Hooks and Context API to handle states in adding products to a cart.


I am creating public repositories for all the practice project I will be doing to improve my Github profile contribution activities.
